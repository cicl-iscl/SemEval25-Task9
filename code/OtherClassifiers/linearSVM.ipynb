Consumers should not consume the recalled product described below. Recalled product Brand Product Size UPC Codes Harvest Fresh Zucchini Spirals 340 g 0 59559 00042 9 24 JUL 2021 C 195 What you should do If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, call your doctor. Check to see if you have the recalled product in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased. Food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness. Pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, the infection can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth. In severe cases of illness, people may die.

The CFIA is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other high-risk products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated Food Recall Warnings.
